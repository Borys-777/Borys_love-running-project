            <p>Dear Ukrainians! </p>
            <br>
            <p> My name is Borys, and I have been living in Ireland since November 2023. Currently I am living in Cork
            city. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I understand your feelings, emotions, fears and thoughts completely, especially when you first came to
            Ireland, without knowing anything or anyone, with your family or on your own, having friends in Ireland or
            not, looking for the job and opportunities to grow. Me, as a Ukrainian, who have been in “your shoes” and
            walked all the way long you are just starting now – can understand you and is willing to help.
            I am extremely grateful to the Irish society, authorities, citizens for a very warm and friendly approach
            and real help to all the Ukrainians, who have been fleeing the war in Ukraine and arrived to Ireland,
            seeking for the protection and support. I hope you are feeling the same gratitude and respect to Ireland as
            I do. </p>
            <br>

        <p>The purpose of this website is to gather all the information I have, related to the support and help
            Ukrainians in Ireland (and mostly in Cork), in order to make your life much easier and as stress-free, as
            possible. This includes: useful groups of Ukrainians in Cork city, scheduling of the upcoming cultural
            meetings, help with accommodation and housing, English courses, Ukrainian classes for the young learners,
            medical-related help and more.  </p>
            <br>

             <p>Feel free to discover this website and get all the benefits it provides!
            Glory to Ukraine and glory to Ireland!  </p>
